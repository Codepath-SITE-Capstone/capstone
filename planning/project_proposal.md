## Problem Statement

As a beauty/makeup product owner I need to be able to dispose/donate my products in a more sustainable and guilt-free way. 

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

By creating this application we can help reduce waste by recycling materials and donating unexpired/unused products to organizations, as well as create a culture around sustainability. There will be a feature to easily drop off and/or send beauty products to be proberly recycled and disposed of and another option of donating unused and unexpired products to shelters and organizations. 

Our Target audience will be millenials and gen Z since they are most impacted by the negative affects of pollution and are most involved with becoming more sustainable. The site will cater to their interests by not only being aestetically pleasing but also extremely efficient and easy with a reward point system involved for every donation. This rewards system will encourage more users to give their unused products to our system since there is the potential to receive a free gift and it is a free service.
