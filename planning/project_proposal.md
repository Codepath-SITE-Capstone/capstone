## Problem Statement

Overarching Problem:
As a beauty/makeup product owner I need to be able to dispose/donate my products in a more sustainable and guilt-free way.

Epic 1: Recycling
  persona 1
  Story: As a recycling user I need to find recycling centers -> page with map, google map api for location centers (what are the tasks needed to complete this       specific task.) 

Epic 2: Donating
  persona 1
  Story: As a person with excess beauty/hygiene products it is very difficult to find people and organizations to donate to 

Epic 3: Culture of Sustainability 
  persona 1
  Story: I want to know and learn how to be more sustainable with my beauty products but I’m not sure where to start. => Tips on how to be sustainable and companies  to support that are sustainable.


## Description

By creating this application we can help reduce waste by recycling materials and donating unexpired/unused products to organizations, as well as create a culture around sustainability. There will be a feature to easily drop off and/or send beauty products to be proberly recycled and disposed of and another option of donating unused and unexpired products to shelters and organizations. 

Our Target audience will be millenials and gen Z since they are most impacted by the negative affects of pollution and are most involved with becoming more sustainable. The site will cater to their interests by not only being aestetically pleasing but also extremely efficient and easy with a reward point system involved for every donation. This rewards system will encourage more users to give their unused products to our system since there is the potential to receive a free gift and it is a free service. 

## Expected Features List
- A home page showing the stats on beauty product waste, options nav bar to choose 

- About page that talks about the website’s brand

- A page that shows locations and stores where used products can be dropped off for recycling (Google Map API)

- A page for tips on how to be  more sustainable with beauty products before and after purchase and show stores that recycle the bottles and are sustainable themselves (ex. Lush, The Ordinary, ect)

Possible Stretch Feature == A point system where users will receive points for each donation and with enough points you get a makeup/beauty kit for FREE!
    >Have user profiles that lets users see how many points they have and other profile information
       > Needed: Have a login/signup page and logout button
       > Use Google or Facebook API to let users have an option to login with those accounts (OAuth)


## Related Work

Terracycle, Pacifica, BeautyShare, Wands for Wildlife, Origins, and Lush are each organizations that have created similar features and share our purpose. However our product will differ from these existing platforms by also including:
  - Tips on sustainability 
  - Ambassador program to register your university/college as a drop off center. 
  - Much easier user experience

## Open Questions

>What design style should we use to make our website appealing to users? We need to research colors or designs usually used in sustainable companies or websites.And let users know somehow  it has something to do with the beauty industry by using maybe a particular font, color scheme, pattern.
     >Specific color scheme?

>We need to research locations and stores that support donating used products. Research tips on how to lead a more sustainable life. 

>What technologies will we need to use in order to implement our capstone’s features? 
      >We need to learn more about MaterialUI or Bootstrap for styling.
         >Learn how to use Figma to help layout the workflow of this project.

>How deep should we go into this project in regards to data collection and management
