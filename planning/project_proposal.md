    - foster sign up/register 
    - login for user
    - page for requirements/commitments 
    - dogs page: name, age, breed, description, location -> click/hover on dog picture you see more details about that dog
    * favorites/watchlist 
    * matching feature -> filter results by energy, size, etc
    
  Target Audience:  
    - those w/ mental illnesses that do not inhibit fostering i.e. anxiety 
 
  Resources:
    1. petfinder:

    2. petfinderapi:

    3. example foster website:
    https://berkeleyhumane.org/recruitment/animal-foster/

filtering businesses for black owned/local/woman owned/ minority owned 

- similar to yelp, search engine based app 
- feature that allows you to save businesses they like -> favorites page -> login/profile needed
- based on location -> google maps api 
- categories ->  beauty stores

2. Beauty Product Sustainability Website (recycling beauty products)

  Target Audience: 
  - millenials/gen Z
  - promote sustainabiltiy within the beauty industry 
  
- used products are dropped off at specific dropoff location recycle them 
- show stores that recycle the bottles and are sustainable itself 
- point system -> with enough points you get a makeup/beauty kit for FREE
- page for tips on being more sustainable 
- home page stats on beauty product waste, options nav bar to choose 

  problem statement
  i have a bunch of beauty product waste what do i do with it 
  
  
  empty -> send/drop off to place that collects and win points
  
  
  not empty/not used -> donate it for and win points 

 
 *unused/unopened/unexpired products go to shelters
 
  Pod Sync advice:
  - "how many hoops to jump through to accomplish a specific feature" -> how many clicks to get information 
  - sign up w/ google etc buttons to make accounts easier for users 
  - fb, google, api 
  - hardest parts can be styling the webpage
  
  style prebuilt-libraries for react 
    1. materialui
    2. bootstrap
  
  organization 
  - separate work via interests, functionality, 
  - functionality -> features like showing items etc 
  
  Workday processes:
  1. design session for features "stories"
  - i.e "as a user i need an account -> i go to this page etc"

  2. 1 week sprint "how much can I complete in this week / this week we will tackle XYZ" 

  3. meetings everyday "scrum" 

  task tracker platforms: 
   - trello 
   - jamboard

Helpful deciding factors:
"what is the bare minimum you'd be happy to present as a capstone project" 

mockup 

features that recruiters look for:
1. experience w a toolset (react, node server, fb API, using materialui, workflow is optimized/thoughout 
2. datascience/data structures -> algorithmic focus
3. ux/ui -> workflow, appearance, first impression!

amount of features:
- what are main features at bare minimum 
- build off of ^

1. brainstorm problem you want to solve w/ project idea
2. brainstorm 10-20 problems and prioritize them by what you want to do most 
3. what are data requirements for each problem -> google free resources for this 
4. 

example of problem statement:

3 parts
WHO - person/actor/user -> user
WHAT - what they want to do -> find black owned business
WHY - why do they want to do this -> 

build empathy with the WHO, understand what their needs are
