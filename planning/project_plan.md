## Problem Statement and Description

As a beauty/makeup product owner I need to be able to dispose/donate my products in a more sustainable and guilt-free way. 

## User Roles and Personas

USER ROLES:
1. Individual with excess products
  - A user who is in need of getting rid of their excess products, but doesn’t want to throw them away.

PERSONAS: 
1. Ryan is a Millennia who is tech savvy and has a smartphone. He is from New York and is tired of seeing all the pollution in the city. He also dislikes fast fashion. In his youth Ryan spent a lot of time trying to become a famous beauty guru online, however he was unable to keep up with the online competition and instead pursued a different career path. He now has plenty of makeup products laying around in his apartment that he doesn't use nor want. Ryan wants to give these good quality products to someone in need, but doesn’t know who or what organization to reach out to. 

2. Like most of Gen Z, Amanda is a prolific social media user and is extremely concerned with environmental issues. She lives in Honolulu, Hawaii and as a result she cares deeply about preserving it. There have been an increase of wildlife dying due to pollution and she wants to learn how she can take action to help the cause .. etc Amanda has recently been obsessed with Tik Tok and the beauty products it’s users promote. As a result, Amanda made many beauty product purchases to feel more trendy. She recently stopped using her makeup products because she has decided to embrace her natural beauty. Instead of contributing to pollution and being wasteful she wants to find an easy eco-friendly way to sustainably get rid of her used products she no longer wants. 

## User Stories

1. As a skincare product lover, I want to be able to donate the products that didn't work out for me to a local donation center, so that I don't have too much clutter of skincare products in my bathroom. (Feature = list donation centers)

2. As a user with many empty makeup bottles, I want to recycle them so that I can get rid of them without throwing them away in the trash. (Feature = list recycling centers)

3. As a user who has donated or recycled products, I want to be able to see how many I have donated/recycled so that I can keep track of them. (stretch feature = reward system, non-stretch = history, incorporate a login/account feature, include in database)

4. As a user who has recently donated some beauty products to the website, I would like to learn more about how to be sustainable. (page for tips on sustainability)

5. As a user, I may not have any current problems of being sustainable when it comes to my beauty products, but I would like to contribute to beauty sustainability by buying only from brands that are sustainable themselves. (page that lists stores and links that are sustainable/eco-friendly)

6. As a user I would like to view stats on sustainability and personal progress. (appears after history page under profile)

7. As a user I want to view and keep track of overall sustainability trends (homepage) 

8. As a user I would like to view other user’s donation milestones/progress (homepage to view others progress OR view others progress directly as a separate tab [need permission to share])

9. As a non-profit organization who wants to promote their donation center I want a way to easily register my center onto the website. 

10. As an individual in need of products I want to be able to find resources that provide information on where/how to get these things (connect that individual to orgs/donation-pantry?)
