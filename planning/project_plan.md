## Problem Statement and Description

As a beauty/makeup product owner I need to be able to get rid of my products in a more sustainable and guilt-free way. 

## User Roles and Personas

USER ROLES:
1. Individual with excess products
  - A user who is in need of getting rid of their excess products, but doesn’t want to throw them away.

PERSONAS: 
1. Ryan is a Millennia who is tech savvy and has a smartphone. He is from New York and is tired of seeing all the pollution in the city. He also dislikes fast fashion. In his youth Ryan spent a lot of time trying to become a famous beauty guru online, however he was unable to keep up with the online competition and instead pursued a different career path. He now has plenty of makeup products laying around in his apartment that he doesn't use nor want. Ryan wants to give these good quality products to someone in need, but doesn’t know who or what organization to reach out to. 

2. Like most of Gen Z, Amanda is a prolific social media user and is extremely concerned with environmental issues. She lives in Honolulu, Hawaii and as a result she cares deeply about preserving it. There have been an increase of wildlife dying due to pollution and she wants to learn how she can take action to help the cause .. etc Amanda has recently been obsessed with Tik Tok and the beauty products it’s users promote. As a result, Amanda made many beauty product purchases to feel more trendy. She recently stopped using her makeup products because she has decided to embrace her natural beauty. Instead of contributing to pollution and being wasteful she wants to find an easy eco-friendly way to sustainably get rid of her used products she no longer wants.
