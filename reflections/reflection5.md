## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 
- just right


* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?
-Not much changed over the course of development, we would prioritize deploying earlier

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?
- The labs/weekly assignments were very helpful in preparing us for the capstone project. Espectially the last assignment since it combined a lot of the technical fundamentals of our website. 


* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)
- The mentors, pod syncs, and wireframes really helped us with planning and thinking out the capstone more effectively.
