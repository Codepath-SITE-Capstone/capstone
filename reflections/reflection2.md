## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 1. The google map API with markers for drop off center 
 2. Donations form submission and previous submission history 
 3. The profile page with all data showing for a user


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 1. Merge conflicts 
 2. Bugs!!! Rendering data bugs 
 3. CSS issues 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We implemented all of our features except for the statistics on sustainability. We were not able to add this feature because we ran into issues preventing us from starting it.
 
* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Our mentors were extremely helpful in helping us with planning and organizing our capstone project. We took advantage of pod sync meetings and 1:1 meetups with mentors to make sure we were getting the most help and advice out of it. We also really found the material.ui resource really helpful in speeding up the designing process. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We consider adding/removing a product from the given list “at risk” since it might break our existing code and create a lot of larger issues such as having to redesign some implementations. 

We also believe that the community page is “at risk” for the time we have left.
