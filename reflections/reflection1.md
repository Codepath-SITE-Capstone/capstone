## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We completed the Login and Registration Forms, the Give form, and did most of the Homepage.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Playing around with Material UI and working with Github.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we did finish all of our planned tasks!

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, the week 4 resources such as the labs and past assignments were helpful in implementing the security middleware and login/registration pages.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Viewing the sustainability statistics feature is considered at risk. If it remains at risk we may focus on fine-tuning the MVP instead of implementing it.
