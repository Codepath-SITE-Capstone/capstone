## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 - Being able to successfully update user information 
 - Correct alignment in the profile page
 - Adding the give form stretch feature 
 - Sorting map markers by distance from current distance

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 - CSS
 - Googlemap API Documentation 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

- Point system wasn't completed because it has been harder to implement than expected
- GoogleMap page isn't complete yet, needs more time

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

- Podsync meeting helped us with organizing and prioritizing tasks as well as helping us get through bugs,
- TAs/Staff support for helping with bugs

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 - Community page, because we need to focus on finishing our current tasks instead of starting a new one.
